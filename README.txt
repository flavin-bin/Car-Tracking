You can download any video to test the code with, but the file has to be called "drive.mp4".
Make sure that, to test the code, you have Python and OpenCV installed in your computer.

To run the code you have to use the command prompt and type "python Car_Tracking.py".
Make sure have the right repository selected and all the files on the same placa as the code.

I used PyCharm to edit the code, but feel free to edit it on any IDE you want.

Have fun!
